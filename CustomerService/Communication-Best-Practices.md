# Customer Service in IT Support

Customer service in IT support is more than just solving technical issues. It’s about creating a reliable and respectful experience for the user. Whether I’m working with end-users, business clients, or executives, I aim to deliver support that is clear, empathetic, and aligned with the expectations of international clients and MSP standards.

## 1. How I Approach a Client in Need 

My goal is to create a sense of trust and assurance from the first moment of contact.

- I start with a professional and polite greeting, using the client’s name if known.
*Hi Sarah, thank you for reaching out. I understand you're experiencing an issue with the VPN. I’ll assist you with that right away.*

- I introduce myself and explain my role.
  *I'm Kizito from IT Support. I'll be helping you through this issue.*

- I acknowledge any urgency or disruption.
  *I understand this might be affecting your workflow. I'll do my best to get this resolved quickly.*

- I provide a brief overview of what I’ll do.
