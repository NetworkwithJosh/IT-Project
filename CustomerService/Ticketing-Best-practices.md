# Ticketing Best Practices (My Personal Workflow)

## Objective

My goal is to ensure every support ticket is clear, accurate, and professionally written. A well-documented ticket should provide full context, show visible progress, and allow anyone, technicians, clients, or managers, to quickly understand what happened, when it happened, and what actions were taken.

Good ticketing builds trust, improves collaboration across teams, and supports accountability in managed environments.

## My Core Principle

I treat every ticket like a technical timeline. Whether the issue is ongoing or resolved, I update the ticket regularly, especially during active troubleshooting.

If an issue is still in progress, I leave meaningful updates every 10â€“15 minutes. These updates include timestamps and the specific steps taken, not generic statements.

**Example:**

`[10:15 AM] Reset user profile, still receiving login error. Currently checking authentication logs on the domain controller.`
