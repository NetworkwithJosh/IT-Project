# Ticketing Best Practices (My Personal Workflow)

## Objective

My goal is to ensure every support ticket is clear, accurate, and professionally written. A well-documented ticket should provide full context, show visible progress, and allow anyone, technicians, clients, or managers, to quickly understand what happened, when it happened, and what actions were taken.

Good ticketing builds trust, improves collaboration across teams, and supports accountability in managed environments.

## My Core Principle

I treat every ticket like a technical timeline. Whether the issue is ongoing or resolved, I update the ticket regularly, especially during active troubleshooting.

If an issue is still in progress, I leave meaningful updates every 10–15 minutes. These updates include timestamps and the specific steps taken, not generic statements.

**Example:**

`[10:15 AM] Reset user profile, still receiving login error. Currently checking authentication logs on the domain controller.`

This approach ensures transparency, continuity, and readiness for escalation if needed.

## My Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initial Summary

I start every ticket with a clear description of the issue, including the user’s report, exact error messages (if any), and the time the problem began.

**Example:**

`[9:42 AM] User reports being unable to log in since 8:45 AM. Error message displayed: "Account locked. Contact administrator." Issue reported via email.`

---
### 2. Documentation of Actions

For every step I take, I record what was done, why it was done, and what the result was.

**Example**

`[9:50 AM] Checked Active Directory – user account was locked after multiple failed attempts. Unlocked account and asked user to try logging in again.`

---
### 3. In-Progress Updates

If the issue is ongoing, I provide updates at reasonable intervals (typically every 10–15 minutes), detailing what I’m doing in that timeframe.

**Examples:**

`[10:05 AM] Remote session established. Reviewing logs on user machine.`  
`[10:15 AM] Found Event ID 1058 – Group Policy error. Investigating DNS resolution and SYSVOL access.`

This not only helps with visibility, but it also provides coverage in case the ticket needs to be handed off or escalated.
