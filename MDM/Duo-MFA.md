# Duo Mobile / MFA

## What is Duo Mobile?
Is a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app developed by Cisco Duo Security. It helps protect your accounts by requiring a second layer of verification (in addition to your password) whenever you log in.

## How it Works?
- You install Duo Mobile on your smartphone.
- When you try to log in to a system that uses Duo, you enter your username and password.
- Instead of logging in immediately, the system sends a push notification or code request to your phone.
- You confirm the login by tapping “Approve” in the Duo Mobile app, or by entering a passcode it generates.

## Key Features?
- Push Notifications: Simplifies login by just tapping “Approve.”
- Passcodes: Works even without internet or cell service by generating temporary codes.
- Biometric Support: Can use fingerprint or face recognition on your phone for extra security.
- Wide Use: Commonly used by universities, corporations, and healthcare providers to secure VPNs, email, cloud apps, and remote access.

## Examples
- If you’re logging into your university email from a new laptop, you’ll type your password, then get a Duo push on your phone. You tap “Approve,” and access is granted.
