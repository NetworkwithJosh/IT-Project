### Services Provided
- Common tasks include installing or updating software, removing viruses, configuring settings, resetting passwords, resolving network issues, and answering technical questions.

### Benefits 
  - Faster Resolution: Issues can be solved immediately without waiting for someone to travel onsite.
  - Cost-Effective: Saves time and money for both the company and the user.
  - Scalable: A single IT team can support users across different cities or even countries.

### Example
