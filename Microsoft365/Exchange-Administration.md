# Exchange Administration

Microsoft Exchange Administration involves managing **email services, mail flow, recipients, security policies**, and troubleshooting email-related issues within an organization.  

As a **IT Support** technician, I will handle tasks related to **user mailboxes, shared mailboxes, groups, email forwarding, message tracing, and mail flow rules** using the **Exchange Admin Center (EAC)** or **PowerShell**.
