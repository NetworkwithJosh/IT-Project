## What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a network management protocol used on IP networks that automatically assigns devices (like computers, phones, or printers) the necessary configuration settings to communicate on the network. Instead of manually entering an IP address and other details, a DHCP server handles it for you.

## DHCP Server
A **DHCP Server** is a device (usually a router or Windows Server) that manages IP address allocation dynamically. Instead of manually assigning static IP addresses to every device, the DHCP server automatically provides them based on predefined rules.
