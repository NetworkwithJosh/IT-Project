## PDQ Inventory

### What is PQD Inventory?
PDQ Inventory is a systems management tool for Windows that helps IT administrators automatically scan, collect, and organize information about computers and devices in their network.

### Computer Scanning & Data Collection
PDQ Inventory scans each machine to gather details such as:
- Hardware (CPU, RAM, disk space, etc.)
- Installed software and versions
- Operating system and patch levels
- Services, running processes, users, and event logs

### Centralized DataBase
- All the collected information is stored in a searchable database.
- Admins can group computers dynamically (for example, “all machines missing a specific update” or “all computers running Windows 10”).
