## PowerShell

### What is Powershell?
- A **PowerShell Cmdlet** is a lightweight, single-function command built into PowerShell for performing specific tasks.
- PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and **scripting language** created by Microsoft.
- A **shell** means you can type commands (like `ping`, `ipconfig`) but with more advanced capabilities.
- A **scripting language** means you can write a list of commands in a file (a **script**) so they run automatically instead of typing them one by one.

### Why Use PowerShell?
- With PowerShell scripting, you can:
  - Perform **Active Directory tasks** → Create, disable, or reset 50 user accounts at once.
  - Handle **Microsoft 365 / Intune tasks** → Assign licenses, reset passwords, configure settings.
