## PowerShell

### What is Powershell?
- A **PowerShell Cmdlet** is a lightweight, single-function command built into PowerShell for performing specific tasks.
- PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and **scripting language** created by Microsoft.
- A **shell** means you can type commands (like `ping`, `ipconfig`) but with more advanced capabilities.
- A **scripting language** means you can write a list of commands in a file (a **script**) so they run automatically instead of typing them one by one.
